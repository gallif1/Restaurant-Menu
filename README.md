# Restaurant Menu App

This project is a restaurant menu application built with Android Studio. It allows users to browse the menu, select items to order, specify quantities, and add custom notes for each item.

## Features

- **Menu Selection**: Users can choose items from the menu.
- **Custom Orders**: Each item can have a specified quantity and optional notes.
- **Local Storage with SQLite**: Selected items are initially stored in an SQLite database, allowing users to modify their order before confirmation.
- **Order Submission**: Once an order is submitted, the selected items are removed from SQLite and stored in Firebase for further processing.
- **Data Persistence**: Ensures seamless storage and retrieval of orders using Firebase.

This app provides a smooth and intuitive ordering experience, combining local data management with cloud storage for efficient handling of restaurant orders.
